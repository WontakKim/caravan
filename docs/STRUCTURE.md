# Caravan — Internal Structure Guide

This document describes the on-disk layout of the Caravan repository after the
initial POC refactoring pass (T-1 through T-4). Its purpose is to make the
chosen structure and the splitting criteria explicit for the next contributor.

---

## 1. Per-Crate Responsibilities

The workspace contains three crates under `crates/`:

| Crate    | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `kernel` | Core execution and model logic: event log, conversation transcript, prompt compilation, model routing, tool harness, and storage. Has no dependency on any terminal or UI library. |
| `tui`    | Terminal user-interface built on [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui). Owns the `App` state machine, the key-event input handler, and the drawing layer. Depends on `kernel` for types and execution. |
| `cli`    | Binary entry point. Wires terminal setup (raw mode, alternate screen, panic hook) and runs the ratatui event loop. Has no business logic of its own; delegates everything to `tui` and `kernel`. |

---

## 2. Kernel Internal Module Families

```
crates/kernel/src/
├── approval.rs          # Approval gate types: ApprovalRequirement / ApprovalGate / ApprovalRequest / ApprovalDecision / ApprovalDecisionRecord / ParsedApprovalRequest / ApprovalResumePlan / ApprovalResumeRecord (pure data; ApprovalDecision is the governance trace that resolves a referenced ApprovalRequest; ApprovalDecisionRecord formats and parses the decision detail string; ParsedApprovalRequest parses an ApprovalRequest event detail string into tool/path/risk/reason fields and converts to ToolRequest; ApprovalResumePlan ties a ParsedApprovalRequest to its request_seq and decision_seq for resume execution; ApprovalResumeRecord formats and parses the ApprovalResume event detail string — resume_detail carries request_seq, decision_seq, tool name, and path; evaluated by ToolEventRunner after ToolPolicy — /approval approve <seq> / /approval reject <seq> append an ApprovalDecision without resuming tool execution; /approval resume <seq> records ApprovalResume then executes the tool)
├── approval_queue.rs    # ApprovalQueue projection over the EventLog: pending (ApprovalRequest events with no valid matching ApprovalDecision) and resolved (ApprovalRequest events resolved by a valid ApprovalDecision event) partitions; a decision is valid when it parses via ApprovalDecisionRecord, references an existing ApprovalRequest seq, and its own seq > request seq (greatest decision seq wins on ties); /approval status shows the pending list and the resume_plans() projection; ApprovalQueue::resume_plans() is a read-only projection of resolved approvals whose decision is Approved and whose tool is supported (read_file / list_files) — each surviving entry is an ApprovalResumePlan carrying request_seq, decision_seq, request_detail, and the parsed ParsedApprovalRequest; consumed plans (those whose request_seq has been referenced by a recorded ApprovalResume event) are excluded from resume_plans() — the plan is consumed on first attempt even if the tool fails and will not reappear in /approval status; no tool execution is performed in this step

```

The `commands/` sub-directory follows the same facade pattern as `events/`:
`commands.rs` re-exports from `commands/types.rs` (Command enum + ParsedInput),
`commands/parse.rs` (parsing logic), and `commands/tests.rs` (unit tests).
`commands/help.rs` is the help catalog — the single source of truth for `/help`
text and parity tests. It is not a parser generator; command parsing remains in
`commands/parse.rs`.

The `tool/` and `model/openai/` sub-directories were introduced in this POC to
give each family a private namespace and prevent flat-file sprawl at the
`kernel/src/` level.

The six top-level `model_*.rs` files are now thin compatibility facades
(`pub use crate::model::<sub>::*;`) over canonical submodules consolidated under
`model/`. The canonical paths are `kernel::model::{config, gateway, registry,
runtime_config, tool_request, types}`; the legacy `kernel::model_*` module paths
(e.g. `kernel::model_gateway::ModelGateway`) and the kernel root re-exports
(`kernel::ModelGateway`, `kernel::ModelRuntimeConfig`, …) continue to resolve
unchanged through the facades. Core adapter types (`ModelAdapter`,
`ModelRequest`/`Output`/`Error`/`Usage`) still live in `model/mod.rs`.

## 3. TUI Internal Module Families

```
crates/tui/src/
├── app.rs          # App struct, constructors, high-level submit() dispatcher, and help_lines
├── app/
│   ├── approval.rs  # handle_approval_command: /approval status, /approval approve <seq>, /approval reject <seq>, /approval resume <seq> (resume branch records ApprovalResume, consumes the plan, then runs ToolPolicy → ToolCall → ToolResult|ToolError)

│   │   ├── request.rs     # /request command handler tests
│   │   ├── policy.rs      # Tool-policy decision tests
│   │   └── approval.rs    # /approval status, approve command tests, and reject command tests
│   └── tools.rs     # handle_tool_command: /tool list, /tool read
├── input.rs        # Key-event handler: maps crossterm KeyEvents → App mutations
├── ui.rs           # Layout-orchestration root: draw() calls each widget's render helper; Nav and Main panel blocks remain inline in draw()
└── ui/
    ├── header.rs        # Header text + render
    ├── inspector.rs     # Inspector text/labels + render
    ├── event_log.rs     # Event-log tailing/highlight + render
    └── prompt_bar.rs    # Input display width + prompt bar + cursor
```

`app.rs` is the command-dispatch root: it owns the `App` struct, constructors, a
high-level `submit()` dispatcher that routes each slash command to the appropriate
handler, and the `help_lines` helper. `app/*.rs` is the per-command handler family:
`handle_approval_command` in `app/approval.rs`, `handle_tool_command` in
`app/tools.rs`, `handle_context_command` in `app/context.rs`,
`handle_request_command` in `app/request.rs`, navigation in `app/selection.rs`,
and screen-log formatting helpers in `app/logging.rs`.

`app/tests.rs` is a thin aggregator that contains only the 11 `mod` declarations
for its child modules under `app/tests/`. Each child module owns a focused group
of tests: `common` provides shared helpers; `lifecycle`, `commands`, `storage`,
`selection`, `model_flow`, `tools`, `context`, `request`, `policy`, and
`app/tests/approval.rs` each own the tests for the corresponding `App` behaviour.
The aggregator is co-located with the module it tests rather than placed in
`crates/tui/tests/`, which would require making internals `pub`. The public
integration-test suite lives in `crates/tui/tests/public_api.rs`.

`ui.rs` is the layout-orchestration root: its `draw()` function computes the
overall screen layout and calls each widget's `render` helper. `ui/*.rs` is the
per-widget render family: `ui/header.rs` owns header text and render,
`ui/inspector.rs` owns inspector text/labels and render, `ui/event_log.rs` owns
event-log tailing, highlight logic, and render, and `ui/prompt_bar.rs` owns input
display width, the prompt bar, and cursor render. Each widget's text/compute
helper and its tests are co-located in the child module.

---

## 4. CLI Responsibility

`crates/cli/src/main.rs` is intentionally thin:

1. Install a panic hook that restores the terminal before printing the panic.
2. Load `ModelRuntimeConfig` from environment variables; exit early on error.
3. Create the `ModelGateway` and the store-backed `App`.
4. Enable raw mode and enter the alternate screen.
5. Run the ratatui event loop (`run_app`).
6. Unconditionally restore the terminal on exit or error.

No business logic lives here. All application behaviour belongs in `tui` or
`kernel`.

---

## 5. EventLog Principles

`EventLog` is an **execution trace**, not a UI view model. The following
constraints are enforced:

- **Execution events only.** `EventLog` records what the system *did*:
  `AppStart`, `UserMessage`, `RunCreate`, `TurnStart`, `PromptCompile`,
  `ModelRoute`, `ModelOutputChunk`, `AssistantMessage`, `ModelUsage`,
  `RunComplete`, `RunFail`, `ModelError`, `ModelToolRequest`, `ToolPolicy`,
  `ApprovalRequest`, `ApprovalDecision`, `ApprovalResume`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `ToolError`,
  `ToolContextAttach`, `ToolContextClear`, `SlashCommand`, `HelpRequest`,
  `LogClear`, `ExitRequest`, `UnknownSlashCommand`.
- **No UI selection, scroll, or focus events.** Events such as "user moved the
  inspector cursor" or "user scrolled the event pane" are pure view state and
  must not enter the log.
- **No `InspectorSelection` events.** TUI-local navigation is not part of the
  execution trace.
- **`ToolResult` stores no full file content.** The `detail` field of a
  `ToolResult` event is a summary (e.g. `tool=read_file status=ok`), not the
  raw file bytes. Large payloads are passed through the in-memory
  `ManualToolContext`; they are never persisted inside `EventLog`.
- **API keys are never recorded.** No event detail may contain authentication
  credentials. `ModelRuntimeConfig` holds keys only in memory and they are
  never stringified into an `AppEvent`.

---

## 6. Model / Tool / Prompt / TUI Boundaries

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Prompt** builds the prompt string from `ConversationTranscript`,
  `ManualToolContext`, and the static read-only `ToolCatalog` prompt section
  (`tool::schema`); it produces the prompt text placed in the `ModelRequest`. It
  does not touch the event log.
- **Model (`model/openai/`)** knows only the wire protocol. It receives a
  `ModelRequest` and returns `ModelOutput`. It has no knowledge of tools,
  prompts, or the event log.
- **Tool (`tool/`)** owns the harness: schema, registry, policy, and event
  runner. It records `ToolPolicy` / `ApprovalRequest` / `ToolCall` /
  `ToolResult` / `ToolError` events but does not interact with the model layer
  directly. The **Approval Gate** (`crates/kernel/src/approval.rs`) sits
  between `ToolPolicy` and `ToolCall`: after `ToolPolicyEngine` produces a
  `ToolPolicyOutcome` (including the `approval_requirement` field), the
  `ApprovalGate` evaluates that requirement and returns
  `Some(ApprovalRequest)` when manual approval is needed (emitting an
  `ApprovalRequest` event) or `None` when the tool may proceed immediately. On
  the production path (`ToolPolicyEngine::read_only()`), `approval_requirement`
  is always `ApprovalRequirement::None`, so no `ApprovalRequest` event is
  emitted and tools run without an approval step.
- **`/tool plan-write <path>`** exercises the mutation-intent → `ToolPolicy` →
  `ApprovalRequest` path directly: it records a `workspace_write` mutation intent
  and routes it through the approval gate, but performs no real file write and
  produces no `ToolCall`/`ToolResult`/`ToolError`. Because no tool is executed,
  there is no resume candidacy; the request is resolved only via
  `/approval approve|reject <seq>`.
- **TUI** reads from `EventLog` and `App` state to draw the screen. It writes
  to `App` state through `input::handle_key`. It never reaches into
  `model/openai/` internals or tool registry internals.

## 7. What Was Split This POC

| Before | After | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Tool logic scattered across flat `kernel/src/` files | `tool/` sub-directory with `events.rs`, `policy.rs`, `registry.rs`, `schema.rs` | Tool harness is a cohesive family with clear internal boundaries |
| OpenAI adapter spread across flat `kernel/src/` files | `model/openai/` sub-directory with `compatible.rs`, `config.rs`, `http.rs`, `request.rs`, `types.rs` | HTTP client, wire types, and config belong together; isolates provider details from the adapter trait |
| `App` tests inside `app.rs` or absent | `app/tests.rs` aggregator + `app/tests/{common,lifecycle,commands,storage,selection,model_flow,tools,context,request,policy}.rs` child modules | Keeps tests co-located without polluting the main module file; avoids forcing internal APIs public; grouping by concern keeps each child module focused and independently navigable |
| Per-command handlers inline in `app.rs` | `app/{tools,context,request,selection,logging}.rs` handler family | Each handler family has a distinct responsibility (`/tool`, `/context`, `/request`, navigation, screen-log formatting); extracting them gives `app.rs` a clean dispatch-root role |
| `runner.rs` tests inline in the production module | `runner/tests.rs` extracted alongside `runner.rs` | Co-locates tests with the module they exercise without crowding the production code; mirrors the `app/tests.rs` pattern |
| `ui.rs` single drawing file | `ui/{header,inspector,event_log,prompt_bar}.rs` render modules | Each widget's render + its text/compute helper + its tests now has a clear home; `draw()` becomes layout orchestration |
| `tool/events.rs` flat module | `events/` subdir: `detail.rs` (event detail string formatters) + `tests.rs` (unit tests) | Isolates detail formatting logic from the runner; keeps tests co-located without crowding the production module |
| `tool/registry.rs` flat module | `registry/` subdir: `path.rs` (workspace path confinement helper) + `tests.rs` (unit tests) | Extracts workspace-root path confinement into a focused module; rejects absolute paths and `..`, canonicalizes root and candidate paths, and verifies the canonical candidate remains under the canonical workspace root to guard against symlink escape; co-locates tests alongside the code they exercise |
| `events.rs` flat module | `events/` subdir: `ids.rs, kind.rs, record.rs, log.rs, tests.rs` | Separate the id/seq, kind, record, and log responsibilities; co-locate tests |
| `model_runtime_config.rs` inline tests | `model_runtime_config/tests.rs` extracted alongside `model_runtime_config.rs` (T-1: **test extraction only** — production code was not split) | Co-locates tests with the module they exercise without crowding the production file; mirrors the `runner/tests.rs` pattern |
| `model_gateway.rs` inline tests | `model_gateway/tests.rs` extracted alongside `model_gateway.rs` (T-2: **test extraction only** — production code was not split) | Co-locates tests with the module they exercise without crowding the production file; mirrors the `runner/tests.rs` pattern |
| `model/openai/http.rs` inline tests | `model/openai/http/tests.rs` extracted alongside `http.rs` (T-3: **test extraction only** — production code was not split) | Co-locates tests with the module they exercise without crowding the production file; mirrors the `runner/tests.rs` pattern |

---

## 8. What Was Deliberately NOT Split

Some files were left as single flat modules despite their length. This was an
explicit decision, not an oversight:

| File | Reason not split |
|------|-----------------|
| `model/mod.rs` core types → `model/core.rs` | The core adapter contract (`ModelAdapter`, `MockModelAdapter`, `ModelRequest`/`Output`/`Error`/`Usage`, `ModelResult`) remains inline in `model/mod.rs`. Extracting it into `model/core.rs` was deferred because the consolidation of the six `model_*` flat files (see §7) already touches every model-family module and lib.rs; splitting core in the same pass would add import churn without a clear boundary win. |

The earlier `model_*` flat files have since been consolidated into the `model/`
family (see §7 and §9); only the `model/mod.rs` core split above remains
deliberately deferred.

---

## 9. Deferred Refactors

The following refactors were identified but intentionally deferred from this
POC pass. Each entry includes the reason it was left for a later iteration.

| Refactor | Reason deferred |
|----------|-----------------|
| `model_*` family consolidation into `model/` | **DONE** — All six top-level `model_config.rs`, `model_gateway.rs`, `model_registry.rs`, `model_runtime_config.rs`, `model_tool_request.rs`, and `model_types.rs` files were folded into canonical `model::{config, gateway, registry, runtime_config, tool_request, types}` modules (`gateway` and `runtime_config` keep their split `tests.rs` under matching subdirs). The top-level files remain as `pub use crate::model::<sub>::*;` compatibility facades, so `kernel::model_*` module paths and the kernel root re-exports are unchanged. Core adapter types still live in `model/mod.rs` — see the `model/core.rs` deferral in §8. |
| `model/core.rs` extraction | Pull `ModelAdapter`/`MockModelAdapter`/`ModelRequest`/`Output`/`Error`/`Usage`/`Result` out of `model/mod.rs` into `model/core.rs`. Deferred from the consolidation pass to limit import churn; revisit once the core contract grows or a second adapter family lands. |
| `events.rs` split | **DONE** — `events.rs` was split into `ids.rs` (EventSeq/RunId/TurnId), `kind.rs` (EventKind + name()), `record.rs` (AppEvent), `log.rs` (EventLog), and `tests.rs` (unit tests) under `events/`. |
| Nav / Main panel blocks in `draw()` | The Nav and Main panel blocks were intentionally left inline in `draw()` because they are small static/literal blocks with no compute helper; a separate file would add navigation cost without clarity. |
| `app/tests.rs` grouping into child modules | **DONE** — The `App` tests were distributed across 11 child modules under `app/tests/` (`approval`, `common`, `lifecycle`, `commands`, `storage`, `selection`, `model_flow`, `tools`, `context`, `request`, `policy`). `app/tests.rs` is now a thin aggregator containing only the 11 `mod` declarations. No tests remain in the aggregator and no grouping candidates are deferred. |
| `tool/registry/types.rs` split | `ToolRegistry`, `ToolRequest`, `ToolOutput`, `ToolName`, and `ToolRisk` remain in `registry.rs`. Splitting the type definitions into a separate file would require re-exporting them through `registry.rs` or changing all existing import paths across the crate. Defer until the type set grows large enough that the boundary becomes unambiguous. |
| `tool/registry/execute.rs` split | The execution path in `registry.rs` is tightly coupled to its type definitions; separating them now would fragment a small module without a meaningful responsibility boundary and cause public-API import churn. Revisit if dispatch logic grows substantially or diverges in ownership. |
| `commands/parse.rs` per-family split | If `/model`, `/agent`, or approval command families grow substantially, `parse.rs` can be split into `parse_tool.rs`, `parse_context.rs`, `parse_request.rs`, and `parse_model.rs` — one parser per command family. Defer until the command family boundary becomes unambiguous. |
| `model/runtime_config` production split into error/env/parser | `model/runtime_config.rs` mixes error types, environment-variable loading, and config parsing. A future split into `error.rs`, `env.rs`, and `parser.rs` sub-modules would give each responsibility a clean home. Defer until the module grows large enough that the boundaries are unambiguous. |
| `model/gateway` production split once gateway routing grows | `model/gateway.rs` currently holds `ModelGateway`, `ModelResponse`, and `ModelRoute` in a single file. A production split makes sense once gateway routing logic grows (e.g. per-provider dispatch, fallback logic, or load-balancing); defer until the routing grows enough to justify a subdir. |
| `model/openai/http` production split once async/streaming/client variants are added | `http.rs` currently contains `StubOpenAIHttpClient` and `BlockingOpenAIHttpClient` as a synchronous stub and blocking client in one file. When async or streaming variants are introduced, split into dedicated modules (e.g. `async.rs`, `streaming.rs`, `client.rs`). Defer until those variants exist. |
| `write_file` execution and sandbox | Safety design documented in [docs/WRITE_SANDBOX.md](WRITE_SANDBOX.md); `write_file` execution and the filesystem sandbox are not yet implemented. Defer until the mutation path is ready for end-to-end wiring. |
| `write_preview.rs` path-safety helper commonization | `write_preview.rs` duplicates a small workspace path-safety check inline because `resolve_in_workspace` is `pub(super)` to `tool/registry/` and cannot be called to validate not-yet-existing target paths. Commonize this check into a shared helper once the actual-write execution path is built. |
| Catalog-driven command completion and docs generation | `commands/help.rs` is the single source of truth for command help text, but command completion (tab-complete in the prompt bar) and automated docs generation from the catalog are not yet implemented. Defer until the command set stabilises and the TUI input handler is ready to consume catalog entries for completion. |

---

## 10. Guiding Principle

> **File splitting is not the goal. It is a means of expressing responsibility
> boundaries.**

A module boundary is justified when it lets you answer the question *"what does
this file own?"* more precisely than the parent file did. Splitting for line
count alone adds navigation cost without adding clarity. Every boundary
introduced in this POC corresponds to a distinct responsibility:

- `tool/` — tool harness (schema, registry, policy, execution)
- `model/openai/` — one HTTP-based provider adapter (wire protocol, auth, config)
- `app/tests.rs` — tests co-located with the module they exercise

Where a clear responsibility boundary did not emerge, the file was left intact.
The deferred items above are candidates for future splits only once their
responsibility boundary becomes unambiguous.
